# libft
My reimplementation of several libc functions plus some more. No bonuses(bloat).
___

The first project at 42cursus.

My rewrite of some functions of C99 library, resulting in 30+ functions. The goals of the project were to understand inner workings of libc functions, to learn bulding c libraries, and not to repeat your code when not needed.

DRY principle was applied except for when it wasn't.
